This folder needs to contain:

<project>Devs.mobileprovision
<project>Store.mobileprovision
signingrequest-developers.csr
signingrequest-distribution.csr

Where <project> is replaced by the name of the project.

The signingrequest files are generated by Marmalade iPhone Sign Request tool.
The mobileprovision files are generated through the iOS Dev Center, under 'Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles'.

Create one csr and provision for the development team and testers.
Create one csr and provision for distribution in the iOS store.

Note, use Testflight to manage testing.  Testflight allows creation of multiple test groups and fine-grained control of which people authorized by the mobileprovision actually receive the builds.
